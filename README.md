# IDA-Lab
Documentation describing my Hyper-V lab setup to explore Deployment Workbench and related technologies.

The author is looking to demonstrate proficiency in:
  - Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT)
  - operating systems deployments
  - PowerShell
  - task sequencing 
  - overall automation
  
There is no particular aversion to Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM), however, my previous experience was with SCCM. 
  
**Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**
The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) is a free tool for automating Windows and Windows Server operating system deployment, leveraging the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 10. In order to support a full Task Sequence, the  Windows PE (Pre-Installation Environemnt) add-on is required.

The ADK, the add-on, and MDT was installed on Windows Server 2016 installation, primarily because of the age of my HP Z420. This server is named LAB.
